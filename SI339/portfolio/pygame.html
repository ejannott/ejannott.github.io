						<h1>Pygame: Defend The City!</h1>
						<p>The goal was to learn how to use the modules within Pygame and code a compelling game using Python that was actually fun to play.  My biggest concern with this project was to make a game that had smooth gameplay and incorporated a number of visual effects.</p>

					<p><br>The objective of the game it to stay alive as as long as possible while also shooting the alien invaders with lasers from your ship - relatively straightforward.  Below are some of the game elements that I coded into the game that I was particularly proud of:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Infinitely continuous scrolling background to simulate movement through space</li>
                    <li>Explosion animation</li>
                    <li>Health bar</li>
                    <li>Shooting laser and explosion sound effect</li>
                    <li>Increasing enemy count as score rise</li>
                    <li>Gameplay music</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
                  <p>The final product of this project was exactly what I was hoping for.  The scrolling background and explosions were the most difficult elements to incorporate.  The background is an image of a cityscape that duplicates itself, puts a copy at far left end of the background image that is on the screen, deletes the background image that falls off screen left, and then repeats this process continuously.</p>
                  <p>The explosions happen by essentially running through a list of images and displaying them quickly on screen.  The challenge here was to write that process into my code in a succinct and effective way.</p>
                  <p>The background and the explosions were the one thing that I definitely wanted to incorporate in order to make the game seem more legitimate and less of a homebrewed side project.  Right now, the game only simulates gameplay.  What I may try to add in the future is a game menu, and a “Game Over” screen with options (because right now the program just crashes when you die) <br></p>
